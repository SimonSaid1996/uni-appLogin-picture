# uni-appLogin-picture
please note that this proejct is inspired by https://uniapp.dcloud.io/casecode. i was combininig the uni-template-login and uni-template-picture project into one.


this project is build within the framework of vue. i was using hbuilderx while building this project. this project can be used in multiple devices(both mobile and web, but please note that the registration function in the project doesn't work in certain mobile devices).this proejct is a prototype project and will need further development if wanting to put into actual use.(not recommended, try to use this as a study case only) because i have build this app in china, i can't use google, facebook or amazon account to do the third party authentication(unforturnately, you can only use third parties like wechat or ali account to login by third party)

in this project, you can find a login section and a picture viewing section. in the login section, you can register a new account(with minor requirements on the account length, password length and email formate). you can also do third party authentication. after logging in, the seeing picture function will come out.you can see pictures of hot, new, tagged and about. if you click on the pictures, there will be an zoom in effect for each pictures that you can view larger version of the pictures.
